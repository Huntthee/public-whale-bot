## Twitch Chat Bot! :robot: :speech_balloon:

*Built by Huntthee*
*with dank-twitch-irc*

## Built for TheDesertWhale's Twitch Stream
This bot is capable of listening for and responding to many things, including raids, sub and gift-subs, commands and so much more!

Feel free to clone this repo and input your own information!

Once the files have downloaded run `npm install dank-twitch-irc`, replace the username, channel name and twitch OAuth token then fire up the bot! Have fun reworking the events & commands, and adding your own!

Big thanks to [robotty](https://github.com/robotty/dank-twitch-irc) for building dank-twitch-irc, a much friendlier way to interact with the Twitch API via node. :thumbsup:
